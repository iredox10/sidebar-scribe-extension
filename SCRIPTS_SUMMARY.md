## Script Usage Guidelines

### Making Scripts Executable
All scripts should be made executable with:
```bash
chmod +x script-name.sh
```

### Running Scripts
Scripts can be run with:
```bash
./script-name.sh
```

### Prerequisites
- **bash**: All scripts are bash scripts
- **Unix-like environment**: Tested on Linux/macOS
- **Node.js**: Required for development and build scripts
- **jq** (optional): For enhanced JSON validation

## Script Dependencies

### Required System Tools
- `chmod`: For setting execute permissions
- `rm`: For removing files and directories
- `zip`: For creating distribution packages
- `grep`, `tr`, `find`: For file operations and searching

### Optional Tools
- `jq`: For detailed JSON validation in validate-manifest.sh

## Error Handling

All scripts include basic error handling:
- Check for required files/directories
- Verify command availability
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Exit with appropriate codes

## Customization

Scripts can be customized by modifying:
- File paths (if project structure changes)
- Confirmation prompts
- Output messages
- Validation criteria

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied
If you get "Permission denied" errors:
```bash
chmod +x script-name.sh
```

### Command Not Found
If commands like `jq` or `zip` are not found:
- Install them using your system's package manager
- On Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install jq zip`
- On macOS: `brew install jq`

### Scripts Not Working
- Ensure you're running them from the project root
- Check file permissions
- Verify all required tools are installed

## Integration with Development Workflow

### New Developer Onboarding
1. Clone repository
2. Run `./dev-setup.sh`
3. Run `./quick-verify.sh` to confirm setup

### Development
1. Run `npm run dev` for development server
2. Make changes
3. Run `./validate-manifest.sh` after manifest changes

### Testing
1. Run `npm run build` to test build process
2. Run `./quick-verify.sh` to verify implementation

### Release Preparation
1. Run `./build-and-package.sh` to create distribution
2. Test the packaged extension
3. Run `./validate-manifest.sh` for final validation

### Maintenance
1. Run `./clean-project.sh` to reset environment
2. Run `./dev-setup.sh` to rebuild environment

## Conclusion

These scripts provide a comprehensive toolkit for developing, building, and maintaining the Sidebar Note extension. They automate common tasks, ensure consistency, and help prevent common mistakes during development and deployment.

Regular use of these scripts will help maintain a healthy development environment and streamline the release process.
